Compilation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
To compile without using bounding volumes, just make.

To run, do ./A5 <scene_file> <subdivisions> <threads>, where scene file is lua file
of the scene you're trying to render. And subdivisions is how many subdivisions
you wish to divide the picture into. And threads is just how many threads the spawned
to work on it.

This was compiled and ran on gl29.
